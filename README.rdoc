Share UP   

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

My first attempt at creating a Angular app with a Rails backend. It will Allow users to login and view a feed of Huffington Post articles and share them their friends.    

Currently I have the feed working, without any styling, and authentication is up.   

Next Steps:   
- Login page   
- Hand rolled styling
